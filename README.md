# ChickenDoor
The purpose of this project is to use a stepper motor to control a door to a chicken house.
I currently have an Arduino Uno Mega with a stepper motor shield and an ESP8266 board hooked to the stepper motor.
I would like to have three modes. Fully manual, automatic close or open based on time of day, and automatic close or open based on sunrise and sunset.
